## Project Status

**Current Phase: Phase 3 - Image Generation Integration & UX Polish (COMPLETE)**

### ✅ Phase 3 Completion: Comedic Style System & Image Preview Modal

**Major Accomplishments (2025-10-27):**

#### 1. Excuse Generation Prompt Redesign
- **Removed:** Wordplay comedic style (didn't work well for excuse context)
- **Added:** 8 comedic styles with rich descriptive guidance instead of examples
  - Absurdist (surreal, impossible scenarios)
  - Observational (modern life observations)
  - Deadpan (formal tone, absurd content)
  - Hyperbolic (exaggerated, epic scale)
  - Self-deprecating (personal incompetence)
  - Ironic (contradictions, opposite outcomes)
  - Meta (fourth wall breaking, self-aware)
  - Paranoid (conspiracy theories, connections)
- **Implementation:** Random rotation system selects one style per generation
- **Result:** Excuses are now genuinely funny, varied, and avoid excessive British cultural references

#### 2. Image Generation Style Matching
- **Visual Styles:** 8 visual styles matching excuse comedic styles
- **Headshot Variants:** Each style has "withHeadshot" and "withoutHeadshot" instructions
- **Text Prevention:** Strengthened NO TEXT rules across all visual styles
- **People Rules:** Explicit guidance preventing generation of known people while allowing strangers
- **Result:** Images now visually align with excuse humor, creating cohesive user experience

#### 3. Full-Screen Image Preview Modal
- **New Component:** `ImageModal.tsx` with:
  - Full-screen dark backdrop (90% opacity)
  - Centered image scaled to fit viewport
  - Close button (top-right, ESC key support)
  - Floating download button (bottom-right, green accent)
  - Auto-close after 800ms delay post-download
  - Click-outside-to-close functionality
  - Download state feedback ("Downloaded! ✓")
  - Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
  - Framer Motion animations
- **Updated UI:** `ImageDisplay.tsx` made clickable with hover effects
  - Scale up 1.02x on hover
  - Dark overlay appears (30% opacity)
  - Maximize icon appears
  - "Click to view full screen" hint text
  - Keyboard support (Enter/Space to open)
- **Result:** Much improved UX for viewing and downloading images

**Verified Working (2025-10-27):**
- ✅ Excuse generation with randomized comedic styles
- ✅ Style-specific visual image generation
- ✅ Full-screen modal with clear download button
- ✅ Auto-close after download with visual feedback
- ✅ Responsive design across mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ No unwanted text in generated images
- ✅ No random people in backgrounds

## Getting Started

### First-Time Setup on a New Computer

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neilastin/not-my-fault.git
   cd not-my-fault
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create `.env.local` file:**
   Create a file called `.env.local` in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key-here
   ```
   **IMPORTANT:** No quotes around values, one variable per line

4. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start BOTH Vite dev server AND API server (required!)
npm run dev:vite # Start only Vite (frontend only, API won't work)
npm run dev:api  # Start only API server (backend only)
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `npm run dev` (not `npm run dev:vite`) to run both servers together!

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Bundler:** Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with custom dark theme
  - **IMPORTANT:** Tailwind v4 uses `@theme` directive in CSS (not tailwind.config.js)
  - Custom theme defined in `src/index.css` using CSS variables
  - Dark background (#0a0a0a) with neon accents (green, blue, purple)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion for smooth interactions

### Backend Architecture - Local Development
- **Custom Dev Server:** `dev-server.js` runs serverless functions locally
  - Loads environment variables from `.env.local` using dotenv
  - Manually injects env vars into `process.env` for TypeScript handlers
  - Runs on port 3001 (API endpoints: `http://localhost:3001/api/*`)
- **Vite Proxy:** Configured to forward `/api/*` requests to dev server
- **Concurrently:** Runs both Vite and API server together with `npm run dev`

### Backend Architecture - Production (Vercel)
- **Serverless Functions:** Vercel Edge Functions in `/api` directory
- **API Proxy:** Functions hide API keys and handle external API calls
- **Environment:** Secure key management via Vercel environment variables

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored in `.env.local` (never committed, in `.gitignore`)
- Serverless functions act as secure proxy for API calls
- No API keys exposed to browser/frontend
- `.gitignore` prevents sensitive data exposure

## Current State

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Full UI built with all components
- ✅ Tailwind CSS v4 custom dark theme working
- ✅ Local development environment with custom API server
- ✅ Claude API integration for excuse generation (2 excuses with 8 comedic styles)
- ✅ Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API for image generation with style matching
- ✅ Full-screen image preview modal with download functionality
- ✅ Drag-and-drop headshot upload with file validation
- ✅ Image caching per excuse type
- ✅ Tabbed interface with smooth animations
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ Loading animations and transitions
- ✅ Responsive design across all breakpoints
- ✅ Accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- ❌ Deployment to Vercel production
- ❌ E2E tests (Playwright)
- ❌ Performance monitoring/analytics

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
  - Create comprehensive E2E tests with Playwright
  - Test excuse generation across all 8 styles
  - Test image generation with/without headshots
  - Test modal interactions and downloads
  - Responsive design testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Phase 5: Deployment to Vercel
  - Configure Vercel project
  - Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
  - Deploy and test production build
  - Monitor for errors
- Phase 6: Optional Enhancements
  - Add more comedic styles
  - Implement history/favorites
  - Share functionality
  - Analytics integration

## Important Technical Notes

### Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration
- **Theme customization in CSS, not JS**: All custom colors, spacing, etc. are defined in `src/index.css` using the `@theme` directive
- The `tailwind.config.js` is minimal (only content paths)
- Uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of `@tailwind` directives

### Environment Variables
- Dotenv alone doesn't work with ES modules
- `dev-server.js` manually copies parsed values into `process.env`
- Format: `KEY=value` (no quotes, no spaces around `=`)

### Local Development Server
- Port 3001 for API (may need to kill stale processes if EADDRINUSE error)
- Vite auto-selects available port (usually 5173+)
- Both servers MUST run together for full functionality

## Agent Workflow Strategy

### Available Specialized Agents

Claude Code has access to specialized agents that should be used for specific types of tasks. **Always delegate to the appropriate agent rather than handling complex tasks directly.**

#### 1. **Explore Agent**
**When to use:** Codebase exploration, understanding project structure, finding files/patterns
**Capabilities:** Fast file pattern matching, code search, reading files
**Use cases:**
- "Where is X feature implemented?"
- "How does Y work in this codebase?"
- "What's the project structure?"
- "Find all files related to Z"
- Any open-ended codebase exploration

**Example triggers:**
- User asks "where..." or "how does..."
- Need to understand code before making changes
- Searching for patterns across multiple files

#### 2. **frontend-architect Agent**
**When to use:** React components, UI architecture, TypeScript frontend work
**Capabilities:** Full toolkit for building/modifying/reviewing React components
**Use cases:**
- Building new React components
- Modifying existing components
- Reviewing component architecture
- TypeScript type issues in frontend
- Vite configuration
- State management patterns

**Example triggers:**
- "Create a new component for..."
- "Fix the React component..."
- "Review my component code"
- "Add TypeScript types for..."

#### 3. **backend-serverless-expert Agent**
**When to use:** Serverless functions, API routes, backend logic, API integrations

**Use cases:**
- Creating/modifying `/api` directory functions
- API key handling and security
- External API integrations (Claude, Gemini)
- Server-side validation
- Backend error handling

**Example triggers:**
- "Create an API endpoint for..."
- "Fix the serverless function..."
- "Integrate X API..."
- "Move this to the backend..."
- Any work in `/api` directory

**IMPORTANT:** This agent should ALWAYS be consulted when:
- Adding new API endpoints
- Modifying existing serverless functions
- Integrating external APIs
- Handling sensitive data or API keys

#### 4. **styling-animation-specialist Agent**

**Capabilities:** Full toolkit for styling and animations
**Use cases:**
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Custom theme modifications
- Framer Motion animations
- Responsive design
- Visual polish and UI improvements
- CSS debugging

**Example triggers:**
- "Style this component..."
- "Add animation to..."
- "Make it responsive..."
- "Fix the Tailwind config..."
- "The design looks off..."

**IMPORTANT for this project:**
- Tailwind v4 uses `@theme` in CSS, not config file
- Custom theme in `src/index.css`
- Dark theme with neon accents (green, blue, purple)

#### 5. **security-guardian Agent**
**When to use:** Security audits, API key handling, input validation
**Capabilities:** Read-only analysis + web research for security best practices
**Use cases:**
- Audit API integrations
- Review serverless functions for security issues
- Check environment variable handling
- Validate input sanitization
- Review authentication/authorization

**Example triggers:**
- After implementing new API endpoints
- After adding environment variables
- Before deploying to production
- When handling user input or file uploads

**IMPORTANT:** Use proactively after any backend/API changes

#### 6. **playwright-tester Agent**
**When to use:** End-to-end testing, UI testing, integration tests
**Capabilities:** Playwright tools for browser automation and testing
**Use cases:**
- Creating E2E tests for new features
- Testing form submissions
- Testing API integrations through UI
- Validating user flows
- Regression testing

**Example triggers:**
- "Test the excuse generation flow"
- "Create tests for..."
- "Verify the form works..."
- After completing features that need validation

#### 7. **devops-deployment-specialist Agent**
**When to use:** Deployment, CI/CD, Vercel configuration, GitHub operations
**Capabilities:** GitHub tools, bash, deployment automation
**Use cases:**
- Deploying to Vercel
- Setting up environment variables in Vercel
- GitHub repository management
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Build optimization
- Deployment troubleshooting

**Example triggers:**
- "Deploy to Vercel"
- "Fix deployment error..."
- "Set up environment variables..."
- "Configure Vercel..."
- Deployment failures (500 errors, build errors)

### Workflow Decision Tree

**When you receive a task, follow this decision tree:**

```
1. Is this codebase exploration/understanding?
   → Use Explore Agent

2. Is this React/TypeScript frontend work?
   → Use frontend-architect Agent

3. Is this serverless function/API/backend work?
   → Use backend-serverless-expert Agent
   → Then use security-guardian Agent for review

4. Is this styling/CSS/animation work?
   → Use styling-animation-specialist Agent

5. Is this testing/validation?
   → Use playwright-tester Agent

6. Is this deployment/DevOps/Vercel?
   → Use devops-deployment-specialist Agent

7. Is this a multi-domain task?
   → Break it down and use multiple agents sequentially
   → Example: "Add styled component with API" =
     a) frontend-architect (component)
     b) styling-animation-specialist (styling)
     c) backend-serverless-expert (API)
     d) security-guardian (security review)
```

---

### Agent Usage Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Always use agents for complex, multi-step tasks
- ✅ Use Explore agent before making changes to unfamiliar code
- ✅ Use security-guardian proactively after backend changes
- ✅ Run agents in parallel when tasks are independent
- ✅ Provide clear, detailed instructions to agents
- ✅ Trust agent outputs and recommendations

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Try to handle complex tasks without agents
- ❌ Use direct tools (Grep/Glob) for open-ended exploration
- ❌ Skip security review for API/backend changes
- ❌ Make styling changes without styling-animation-specialist
- ❌ Deploy without devops-deployment-specialist guidance
