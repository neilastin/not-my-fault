# Test Suite Summary - Not My Fault Image Generation

## Overview

Comprehensive end-to-end test suite for the image generation feature has been successfully created using Playwright.

## Statistics

- **Total Tests:** 126 tests across 3 browsers/viewports
- **Test Files:** 3 main test suites
- **Test Fixtures:** 4 files (2 valid images, 1 invalid file, 1 oversized image)
- **Browser Coverage:** Chromium (desktop), Mobile Chrome, Tablet iPad Pro
- **Unique Test Scenarios:** 42 unique test cases

## Test Files Created

### 1. `playwright.config.ts`
Playwright configuration with:
- 90-second timeout per test (image generation is slow)
- Sequential execution (prevents API rate limiting)
- Automatic dev server startup
- Screenshot/video on failure
- HTML report generation
- 3 browser projects (desktop, mobile, tablet)

### 2. `tests/image-generation.spec.ts` (Main Test Suite)
**7 test scenarios covering:**
- Happy path: Generate image without headshot
- Happy path: Generate image with headshot
- Happy path: Remove uploaded headshot
- Happy path: Switch between excuse tabs (separate images per tab)
- Happy path: Download generated image
- Validation: Photo Evidence only shown after excuses generated
- Validation: Images reset when new excuses generated

**Key Features Tested:**
- Complete excuse → image generation flow

## How to Run Tests

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run in interactive UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run and see browser
npm run test:headed

# View latest report
npm run test:report
```

### Run Specific Tests

```bash
# Run only main tests
npx playwright test tests/image-generation.spec.ts

# Run only error handling tests
npx playwright test tests/image-generation-errors.spec.ts

# Run only responsive tests
npx playwright test tests/image-generation-responsive.spec.ts

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test -g "should generate image without headshot"

# Run on specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chrome
npx playwright test --project=tablet
```

## Test Execution Time

| Test Suite | Tests | Estimated Time | Notes |
|------------|-------|----------------|-------|
| image-generation.spec.ts | 7 | 15-20 min | Multiple image generations |
| image-generation-errors.spec.ts | 17 | 10-15 min | Includes API mocking |
| image-generation-responsive.spec.ts | 18 | 20-25 min | Multiple viewports |
| **Total (all browsers)** | **126** | **45-60 min** | Sequential execution |

## Key Testing Patterns

### 1. Helper Functions
Reusable functions for common tasks:
- `generateExcuses(page)` - Generate excuses before testing image feature
- `scrollToPhotoEvidence(page)` - Scroll to Photo Evidence section

### 2. Waiting Strategies
Proper waits for async operations:
- `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` - Wait for page load
- `toBeVisible({ timeout: 75000 })` - Long timeout for image generation
- `waitForTimeout(500)` - Wait for animations

### 3. Accessibility Testing
Verify ARIA labels and semantic HTML:
- `aria-label` on file input
- `aria-label` on icon buttons
- `aria-busy` during loading states

### 4. Responsive Testing
Test across multiple viewports:
- `test.use({ viewport: VIEWPORTS.mobile })`
- Verify layout changes at breakpoints
- Test touch interactions on mobile/tablet

### 5. Error Mocking
Mock API responses to test error scenarios:
```typescript
await page.route('**/api/generate-image', (route) => {
  route.fulfill({
    status: 500,
    body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Internal server error' }),
  });
});
```

## Important Notes

### Prerequisites for Running Tests

1. **Environment Variables Required:**
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For excuse generation
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For image generation
   - Must be in `.env.local` file

2. **Development Server:**
   - Tests automatically start `npm run dev`
   - Requires both Vite (5173) and API server (3001) running
   - Config option: `reuseExistingServer: true` (reuses if already running)

3. **Test Fixtures:**
   - Test images must exist in `tests/fixtures/`
   - Run fixture setup scripts if missing

### Known Limitations

1. **Slow Execution:**
   - Image generation takes 30-45 seconds per request
   - 126 tests across 3 browsers = 45-60 minutes total
   - Sequential execution required (API rate limiting)

2. **API Dependency:**
   - Tests require valid API keys
   - Tests will fail if APIs are down or rate-limited
   - Some error tests mock APIs to avoid dependency

3. **Browser-Specific:**
   - Tests run on Chromium by default
   - Firefox/WebKit support available but commented out
   - Mobile/tablet use Chromium with different viewports

### Recommended Development Workflow

1. **During Development:**
   ```bash
   # Run specific test you're working on
   npx playwright test -g "your test name" --headed

   # Use UI mode for interactive development
   npm run test:ui
   ```

2. **Before Committing:**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests on Chromium only
   npx playwright test --project=chromium
   ```

3. **Before Deploying:**
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite (all browsers)
   npm test
   ```

4. **Debugging Failures:**
   ```bash
   # Run in debug mode
   npm run test:debug

   # View traces
   npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
   ```

## Success Criteria

All tests should:
- ✅ Pass consistently (not flaky)
- ✅ Complete within timeout limits
- ✅ Generate screenshots on failure
- ✅ Provide clear error messages
- ✅ Cover all critical user flows
- ✅ Test error scenarios thoroughly
- ✅ Verify responsive behavior
- ✅ Validate accessibility features

## Next Steps

1. **Run Tests Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Review Test Report:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:report
   ```

3. **Fix Any Failures:**
   - Check `.env.local` has valid API keys
   - Verify dev server starts successfully
   - Review test output for specific errors

4. **Integrate into CI/CD:**
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up secret environment variables
   - Configure test reporting

5. **Expand Test Coverage:**
   - Add performance testing
   - Add visual regression testing
   - Add API contract testing
